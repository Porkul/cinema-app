### How the Admin Panel Works

Authorized administrators can log into the admin panel to manage movies. The admin panel provides functionalities to add new movies to the database, update existing movie details, and remove movies.

- `POST /admin/movies` - To add a new movie
- `PUT /admin/movies/{movieId}` - To update an existing movie
- `DELETE /admin/movies/{movieId}` - To delete a movie

These endpoints are secured so that only users with admin roles can access them.
